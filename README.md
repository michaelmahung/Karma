# Karma

## Premise

This was my first large project and as such, contains a wide range of different programming styles.
As with all of my projects, many of the features of this project have been updated as I learned more,
but many of the scripts that are integral to the functionality of KARMA! are built using code
that is difficult to refactor. The idea behind the game was to make something that would be easy to play,
but hard to master, and reminiscent of cabinet arcade games. I wanted there to be a clear sense of progression,
and a beginning and end.

This game was relased cross platform for iOS and Android.

Everything in this game was made by me except for the music, which I asked a friend to make for the game.

## Things I Learned

First and foremost, 
> I learned how to release a game with this project, and that its very difficult.

Most of the time taken to completele this game was with debugging and and integrating external services,
but in the end, what needed to get done got done.
